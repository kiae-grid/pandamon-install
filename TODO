Inject ORACLE_HOME for virtualenv creation step
===============================================

cx_Oracle needs to know where Oracle lives.  It can be done either via
ORACLE_HOME (something like ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib64/oracle/11.2.0.4.0/client),
or via PATH.  Since we're doing "su" to the target user, we should either
inject ORACLE_HOME or extend PATH.  Not sure which route to take, need to
experiment.


Customize core-common-settings-local.py to avoid including MySQL
================================================================

Currently this template explicitely selects MySQL as the database
backend.  This harms when we're doing Oracle-based setup, because
MySQL DB driver can be missing.  But the last installation step
(config-instance) runs Django, so it should be able to at least
to load the proper DB backend.

Some more templating is needed.
