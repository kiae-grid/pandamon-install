Installation suite for PanDA monitor
====================================

This suite was created to make PanDA monitor installation
for development purposes to be easy and reproducible.

In a nutshell, you should

 - adopt the configuration file for your needs
   (look at cfg/ for examples),

 - possibly modify or create new checkout script
   (look at settings/*.checkout),

 - [in rare cases] extend PIP requirements list
   (look at pip-*.list),

 - run ./install.sh -c <CONFIG>

Slightly more advanced stuff
----------------------------

./install.sh -h will give you the list of default installation steps.
You can rerun any with ./install.sh -c <CONFIG> <STEP-NAME> <STEP-NAME>.



Layout
======


Suite files
-----------

Directory "libexec" contains scripts that drive various parts
of installation process.  When a new stage is added, install.sh
should get wrapper for this procedure to pass proper parameters
to the script.

Directory "templates" holds template files that will be used
during the installation phase.  You can tune them to your taste
or create new ones.  When you see something like @@VARIABLE@@
inside template file, this is the placeholder for the corresponding
item in the target file.

Directory "settings" contains input files for various stages.
Currently it holds checkout scripts and PIP requirement files.


Installed software
------------------

For each installation we will create its own user, Python virtualenv
and standard directory structure under user's directory.  It will
look like this:

 $HOME
   |
   -> src/
   |   |
   |   -> shibsso/
   |   |
   |   -> panda-bigmon-core/
   |   |
   |   -> panda-bigmon-atlas/
   |
   -> venv/
   |   |
   |   -> <standard virtualenv stuff>
   |
   -> settings/
   |   |
   |   -> settings_bigpandamon_atlas.py
   |
   -> logs/

The idea is to have separate directories (or symlinks to directories)
with distinct parts of PanDA monitoring to be able to work with
development repositories without installing anything.  We had also
separated settings_bigpandamon_atlas.py to their own directory to
be able to tune environment without disturbing sources.  Ideally,
local.py from both panda-bigmon-core and panda-bigmon-atlas should
also go into settings, but we hadn't yet done that (since it will
be good to depart from Python modules and turn to configuration files
here).


Checkout scripts
----------------

Each checkout file has line-oriented format.  Lines that start
with hash ('#') that is possibly preceeded with some whitespace
are comments.  The rest of the lines hold name of the component
to install (first word) and shell command that will install the
component.  It is expected that for each component the directory
(or symlink) named after the component will be produced under
$HOME/src/ directory.  These directories will be put into Python
path for Django in the same order as they appear in checkout
script.



Miscellaneous things
====================

This suite works for ATLAS monitoring part when it is deployed with
CentOS 6.x and Apache/mod_wsgi.



TODO
====

 - There are some hardcoded values like "/etc/httpd/conf.d", "apache",
   "0640".  They probably should be put into some common configuration
   file.

 - Currently we can handle only ATLAS.  I feel that minimal changes are
   needed to handle LSST, but this is to be verified.
